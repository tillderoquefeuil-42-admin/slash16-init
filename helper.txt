LEXIQUE:
    • IP (Internet Protocol):
		-> "inet" from interfaces
    	-> X1.X2.X3.X4 where 0 ≤ Xn ≤ 255
    • MAC (Media Access Control):
		-> "ether" from interfaces
		-> X1:Y2:Y3:Y4:Y5:Y6 where 0 ≤ Yn ≤ FF
	• DNS (Domain Name System):
		-> translate domain name to IP address
	• Routing tables:
		-> structure with : address, static routes, dynamic routes, default route
	• Gateway:
		-> link between two networks
	• nat (Network Address Translation):
		-> output
	• DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):
		-> deliver IPs
	• (network) firewall:
		-> all rules to allow or deny passage of network traffic
